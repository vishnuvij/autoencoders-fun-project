# 🧠 Image Autoencoder – Image Reconstruction Demo

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to **recreate images using an autoencoder neural network**. Autoencoders are a type of unsupervised learning model that learn efficient data encodings, primarily used for dimensionality reduction or image reconstruction tasks.

## 📓 Notebook: `recreate image auto encoder.ipynb`

This notebook walks through the full pipeline of:

- 📥 **Loading image data** (typically from datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10)
- 🧠 **Building an autoencoder architecture** using deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- 🎯 **Training** the model to minimize reconstruction error
- 🖼️ **Visualizing reconstructed images** compared to original input

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib torch torchvision
